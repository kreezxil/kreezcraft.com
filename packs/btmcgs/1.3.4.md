## Notes
Saw some crashes went to report them, but noticed the mod had updated. So instead of reporting I'm grabbing the update. It has been my experience that tends to resolve the issue. Even if the author doesn't acknowledge it.

Added DRP - Global Data Pack so that we can modify parts of other mods using datapacks but in a distributable way as the files are stored in the config/
