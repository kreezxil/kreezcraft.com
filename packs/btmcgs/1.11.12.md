![BETTER THAN MINECOLONIES GETTING STARTED LOGO](https://github.com/kreezxil/kreezcraft.com/blob/master/images/better%20than%20minecolonies%20getting%20started.png)

## Notes
**Forge** on build **28.1.85**

## Proposed Removals
None of  the proposed removals could be made. The world remembers the mods and pitches a fit. The only solution is to wipe the world after removing the mods. I don't think any player of this pack wants to endure that. The mods proposed for removal will remain.

FYI, I've been attempting to upgrade this pack for the past 12 hours with those removals and to no avail. I strongly suggest not making any more mod requests after this patch and just request that I update it once in a while.
