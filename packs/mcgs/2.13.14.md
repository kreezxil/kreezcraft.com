**New Configs** and **New Forge** build **28.1.34**. Please copy your configs and please update your Forge.

Genetic Animals updated not sure if it fixes our issue or not. We can spawn vanilla animals just fine tho, I tested that. Please test this, if we still have issues then in as much as I would hate to do so I will remove this mod.

Added Toast Control to get rid of those stupid messages, because my god MOJANG we know what ASWD is and everyone has heard about punching wood! Honestly it should ask if we need the tutorial or not, that would be better.
