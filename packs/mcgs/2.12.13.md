Yet more Minecolonies updates, fixes. It's gonna be like this as I always do the ALPHAS with them as it helps generate bug reports so that mod will advance.
Added a server utility mod that provides returning spawn, totally excellent for when you get trapped in the nether because you did /mc home by mistake in there. Sadly it has random teleport stuff which I don't like so I've requested a config for disabling those commands. If you don't intense server lag don't use those commands. Don't complain to me about server lag caused by random teleporting. Bear in mind that doing that loads 144 chunks simultaneously on a server. or whatever the square of the view distance on the server is set to, mine is 12, therever 12x12 is 144.
