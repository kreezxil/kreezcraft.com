## Notes
No Hostiles Around Campfire causing server level crashes. There is a major update hoping this fixes it, else we may avoid using it in the future until the mod author is able to have his own server that players can get on and crash his mods and he can witness the pain first hand.

## Removed
- No Hostiles Around Campfire
- Healing Campfire

we will revisit both once all the issues are resolved. 1.14.4 is really really unstable, I might just switch to release only mods for this pack.
Except for the one we do need to
